A simple fullstack application for creating and tracking a to-do list

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<p>Utilized JavaScript, Node, Express, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB resulting in a simple CRUD app.</p>


<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>
<p>By commenting each line of code within this app, I was able to familiarize myself with all the tools used to build it and how each file, and function within those files communicate with eachother to produce a functioning application.</p>


<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>Styling, making the application responsive and adding some other common task management features.</p>
